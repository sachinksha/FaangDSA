## Problems:
### Arrays
1. **LeetCode Problem 1** 

    **findTwoSum** : Given an array of integers, return the indices of target sum. 
2. **LeetCode Problem 11** 

    **Two Shifting Pointers** - **maxArea** : Given an array of positive integers representing a vertical line on a chart, where the base is the x-axis, find two lines that would contain the greatest amount of water. return the area of water it would hold. 
3. **LeetCode Problem 42** 

    **Hard array problem** Critical thinking problem; Given an array of integers representing an elevation map, where width of each bar is 1, return how much rain water can be trapped
4. **LeetCode Problem 844** 

    **String problem - Backspace Compare** - compare two strings A, B check if they are equal. every "#" is a backspace character.

5. **LeetCode Problem 3**
    **String problem - Longest substring without repeating characters** - Return the length of longest contigious substring without repeating characters

6. **LeetCode Problem 125**
    **String Problem - Subproblem - Palindromes** - Check if given string is a valid palindrome. Standard problem.
    Assume only alpha numberic characters are valid. remove spaces, punctuations, etc

7. **Linked List Problem**
    **Reverse a given Linked List**

8. **Doubly linked list Problem**
    **Subproblem - Flatten a given doubly linked list**

9. **Cycle detection in a linked list**
    **Floyd's tortoise and hare algorithm** - Implementation of the algo to check for cycle in a given linked list and get the starting point.

10. **Stack Datastructure**
    **Subproblem - check for string with paranthesis for validity**

11. **Stack Problem**
    **Subproblem** - Remove the least number of brackets to make a given string with brackets a valid string. It may only contain brackets and lower case characters.

12. **Queue Datastructure**
    **Implement Queue using stack datastructure**

13. **Sorting Problem**
    **Get the Kth largest element of an unsorted array** - Ignore duplicates - Use qick sort to sort the array first
